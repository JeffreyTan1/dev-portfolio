One night I was trying to get to sleep but then this question popped up in me head.

## Year 1 Semester 1
#### COSC2627 Discrete Structures in Computing
##### Difficulty: 10/10
I thought I was good at maths before this course humbled me. There is a lot of reading to do. If you're like me, most of the concepts are unintuitive at first. You need to ask questions and let concepts marinate through practice and repetition. Remember, you can submit questions anonymously and don't be afraid to look stupid — the tutors love to help.

#### COSC2473 Introduction to Computer Systems
##### Difficulty: 5/10
Have you ever wondered how computer components such as CPUs and GPUs work? What's the IP protocol and how are messages sent over the internet? This course will surely answer all of your burning questions. It is lots of information to absorb, so you may need to go over things again to commit them to memory.

#### COSC1284 Programming Techniques
##### Difficulty: 7/10
Get introduced to programming through Java. You'll write beginner code because you are one, you're not expected to be a pro right off the bat. The goal is to become familiar with the fundamentals of programming languages. Do your best to avoid programming line-by-line, sprinkle in some functions/methods for code reuse, always avoid magic numbers, and generally build good habits.

#### COSC2628 User-centred Design
##### Difficulty: 6/10
You'll glide through this course easily, but make sure you're paying attention. Creating beautiful and functional UI/UX is not an easy task — a lesson I've learned the hard way as a solo developer. You may find yourself using design heuristics and tools like Figma more than you think. 

## Year 1 Semester 2
#### COSC2536 Security in Computing and Information Technology
##### Difficulty: 7/10
The internet is protected by a collection of powerful cryptographic techniques and protocols. Every developer should know the mathematics behind these concepts to avoid vulnerabilities when creating applications. You will apply these concepts to mock scenarios to demonstrate understanding so you will have to understand them back-to-front. Once you learn them they are hard to forget.

#### COSC2391 Further Programming
##### Difficulty: 8/10
You will learn how to structure your code in object-oriented programming patterns. This makes maintaining and organising code much easier. The final assessment is to create a game with a GUI that you can show off to your friends. The concepts explained in this course may over-complicate things for you. Try to consult YouTube as it will explain things in a less "academic" fashion.

#### ISYS1057 Database Concepts
##### Difficulty: 7/10
Apps use databases to store information. One type of database is the relational database which you can query using SQL. Knowing how these databases are set up, organised, and optimised are required to create modern apps. Try to use online tools to draw out your entity-relationship diagrams, and [here](http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/normalization_tools/normalization/ind.**php**) is a website that can normalise dependencies for you.

#### MATH2350 Introduction to Analytics
##### Difficulty: 6/10
Data science is one of the main branches of Computer Science. You will write a detailed report analysing a large dataset with regression models. Be meticulous with the data, and follow the lecturer's code closely.

## Year 2 Semester 1
#### COSC2123 Algorithms and Analysis
##### Difficulty: 9/10
Computers these days are fast, but if a calculation is performed using an inefficient algorithm you may not get your answer in an acceptable timeframe. This is not an easy course as you are assessed on the ability to come up with original algorithmic solutions to problems that require lots of creativity. Once you understand how an algorithm is designed for one use case, you can look to translate similar methodologies to your algorithms.

#### COSC1076 Advanced Programming Techniques
##### Difficulty: 8/10
Sort of like Further Programming but now in C++. You will learn some more patterns and tips to make your code more maintainable, readable, extendable. The assignments will be quite challenging. You'll be asked to implement a pathfinding algorithm for a 2D maze, and to recreate a board game — my class did Qwirkle. Since these programs are non-trivial, you must start applying good coding style, or you will get stuck with impossible to find bugs.

#### ISYS1118 Software Engineering Fundamentals
##### Difficulty: 7/10
Create a piece of software in a group of people that simulates software development in the workplace. You won't have learnt web development before, but get ready to learn it in your own time or you might struggle to understand what the heck is going on in the codebase. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can all be learnt on YouTube or LinkedIn Learning. It can be boring at times, but you must not skip and skim through tutorials, your future self will be in an infinitely better position.

#### COSC2675 Rapid Application Development
##### Difficulty: 6/10
Learn how to create web apps using the popular Ruby on Rails framework. Once again, if you haven't touched the web before, I highly recommend that you learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript at the beginning when things are quiet. Setting up the development environment can be quite confusing. I recommend following the instructions from the textbook rather than the tutorial notes.

## Year 2 Semester 2
#### COSC1107 Computing Theory
##### Difficulty: 10/10
A fascinating course that goes into the mathematics that defines what can and cannot be computed by any computer. You will demonstrate your understanding by applying proofs to different situations. Props go to Alan Turing for making this course possible. My only advice is to ask questions frequently about the assignments, the tutors and lecturer constantly drop clues.

#### COSC2299 Software Engineering: Process and Tools
##### Difficulty: 8/10
Like Software Engineering Fundamentals, you will be creating a web app in a team. This time, using modern frameworks used in industry. You will be introduced to the world of DevOps which automates the process of deploying your website to a cloud provider. You must learn these new frameworks on your own. You may be ticked off about this, but forcing you to be self-taught genuinely gives you the experience to learn new things on the fly.

#### COSC1114 Operating Systems Principles
##### Difficulty: 7/10
Like Introduction to Computing Systems but this time with even more low-level detail, particularly discussing implementations in the Windows and Linux operating systems. You will be asked to code these low-level systems, which can be quite tough. Brush up on your C/C++ skills from Advanced Programming Techniques, and don't start coding until you truly understand what you are trying to implement.

#### COSC2738 Practical Data Science
##### Difficulty: 7/10
Like Introduction to Data Analytics, but this time you are working with open-source Machine Learning algorithms. You are assessed by the performance of your models as well as your ability to report findings. You must be meticulous at every step of the process: cleaning, exploration, modelling, evaluation, the whole lot. Make sure you are using the most appropriate data manipulation tools from the data structures and methods provided in *NumPy* and *Pandas*. My personal favourites are ```loc``` and ```iloc``` from *Pandas*.

## General Advice
#### Getting Help

If you find yourself stuck on something, like your code isn't working, or the lectures don't explain how to answer this question, try these:
1. Google it, there is usually an answer on StackOverflow/StackExchange
2. Find a tutorial on YouTube
3. Email your tutor/lecturer
4. Ask a friend

Generally, you want to avoid wasting time figuring something out yourself. Someone out there has probably faced the same issue and has lovingly posted the answer online for situations just like this.

#### Managing Time

- If you're forgetful like me try using a to-do app. I use *Microsoft To-Do* on my desktop, laptop, and phone. It syncs my to-do lists between all my devices. 
- Make sure you are checking your email regularly, and know when tests and assignments are due. 
- There isn't a need to get ahead of assignments when haven't learnt the content yet.
